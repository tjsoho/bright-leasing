      "Approaching my 50s, and busy with a demanding corporate career, I was aware that aging might start to affect my performance day-to-day. Whilst most people might consider this a normal part of the aging process, I chose differently. Why give up on feeling and being my best just because I'm getting older. As a busy CEO, I had always been determined to outperform myself each day. Having failed to find a product to support my health in the way I needed, it was my wife and co-founder Samantha who suggested I should create something for myself. The aim was to create a product that would support me to unlock my full potential and perform at my best. And there was no question, the formula had to be the best it could be, focusing on performance of the product over profit. To this day, STAIT is family owned so we aren't constricted by vulture capitalists with onerous financial targets to meet.",
